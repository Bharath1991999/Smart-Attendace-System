# Geofencing
1. Geofencing is a location-based service in which a software uses GPS, RFID, Wi-Fi or cellular data to trigger a pre-programmed action when a mobile device enters or exits a virtual boundary set up around a geographical location, known as a geofence.
2. Here this virtual boundary is set to classroom boundary

# Future Scope
1. Development of android and ios app for better user experience
2. A portable device with two ultrasonic sensors can be developed to keep the count of people in the classroom. Two ultrasonic sensors are placed side by side at the entrance of the classroom to know whether a person is entering or leaving the classroom and count can be incremented or decremented respectively. Count from this device can be used to cross-check the attendance marked through QR code
# Conclusion
Developed a web application with facial authentication, able to generate qr code, mark attendance successfully and avoid proxies with the help of facial authentication and geofencing
